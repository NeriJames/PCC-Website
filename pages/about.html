            <h3>History</h3>

            <p><strong>The Immaculate Conception: Pasig Catholic College’s Patron Saint</strong></p>
            <p>
                The Immaculate Conception, the Beloved Mother and Special Protector, is PCC’s patron saint. 
                The Spanish Missionaries placed the whole country under her special protection by making her 
                the country’s patron saint. During the 1760’s, Pasig was one of the few immediate areas that 
                saw the presence of the Spaniards. Settlements were built around the church, a familiar structure 
                and one of the living pillars of the Hispanic era. Soon, priests were seen outside of the pulpit, 
                gathering people, children and old folks alike, preaching and educating them on the values and virtues 
                of Christianity. For these reasons, Pasig Catholic College, presently a Diocesan College of Pasig, has 
                long adopted the Immaculate Conception as its patroness. Mary’s hidden life, an eloquent testimony 
                of deep faith, purity, courage, wisdom and obedience to the Father’s Will is what the College has 
                always wished for her students and employees to emulate.
            </p>

            <p><strong>The De Brouwer Legacy: PCC’s Early Years</strong></p>
            <p>
                Out of the desire and determination of the Belgian CICM Missionaries to build a Catholic school for 
                teaching children the love of God while passing on the cultural heritage and tradition of the people, 
                Pasig Catholic College was founded by Rev. Fr. Pierre Cornelis de Brouwer, CICM in 1913. It was known 
                as “Escuela Catolica” during the early 1900’s.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 1916, during the time of Rev. Fr. Paul Hubaux, CICM, the American government recognized the primary 
                school. In 1920, under the administration of Rev. Fr. Godfried Aldenhuijsen, CICM, the intermediate 
                levels were approved for operations. As the population grew in 1931, Rev. Victor De Klerck, CICM saw 
                the urgency of constructing what would be the school’s first building, Bahay Paaralan, composed of eight 
                classrooms built in the Church patio. In 1939–41, the Urbano Building was constructed under Rev. Fr. 
                Urbain (Urbano) Timmermans, CICM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pasig Catholic College was originally incorporated in accordance with Philippine Laws on 24 August 1915. 
                After World War II, the Articles of Incorporation were reconstituted on 12 August 1948 and filed with the 
                Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The transcript of these Amended Articles of Incorporation was 
                issued on 03 February 1949.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Rev. Tjolle’s Arrival in 1951</strong></p>
            <p>
                The arrival of Rev. Fr. Roger Bruno Eduard Tjolle, CICM, in 1951 opened a new chapter for the school, 
                now known as Pasig Catholic College, as secondary and tertiary levels were duly recognized. Rev. Fr. 
                Tjolle introduced the American label of education to the Philippines through PCC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Several infrastructure changes were seen during the administration of Rev. Fr. Josef Van den Daelen, CICM 
                (1957–1962). In 1965, he appointed lay Filipino administrators to key school positions. Rev. Fr. Karel 
                Ooteghem, Rev. Fr. Paul de Bevere, and Rev. Fr. Lambert Smits—all CICM priests—later became PCC school 
                directors from the mid-60s to early 70s.
            </p>

            <p><strong>From Belgian to Filipino Directors</strong></p>
            <p>
                Founded by CICM, PCC moved towards Filipinization in 1973 with Msgr. Gaudencio B. Rosales as School Director 
                under MAPSA administration (1973–1979), followed by Msgr. Manuel Sobreviñas (1979–1993), Msgr. Emmanuel V. 
                Sunga (1993–1997), Msgr. Manuel G. Gabriel (1997–2003), Msgr. Gerardo O. Santos (2004–2015), Rev. Fr. Orlindo 
                F. Ordoña (2015–2021), and Bp. Mylo Hubert C. Vergara (2021–present).
            </p>

            <p><strong>First Filipino Director: Msgr. Gaudencio B. Rosales</strong></p>
            <p>
                Before becoming an iconic figure of the “Pondo ng Pinoy” advocacy, Msgr. Rosales served as PCC School Director 
                (1973–1976). He emphasized that PCCians, given quality Catholic education rooted in heritage and character, 
                will achieve success and eternal life with God.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Msgr. Sobreviñas’ Charism</strong></p>
            <p>
                Msgr. Manuel Sobreviñas’ charismatic leadership strengthened PCC’s culture of service and volunteerism. Serving 
                concurrently as MAPSA Superintendent, he helped solidify MAPSA’s institutional development.
            </p>

            <p><strong>A Wave of Changes Under Msgr. Sunga’s Leadership</strong></p>
            <p>
                Msgr. Emmanuel Sunga and Assistant Director Rev. Alfredo M. Ramos oversaw major developments, such as the 
                five-story Administration (now Msgr. Suñga) Building, new school canteen, and the gradual introduction of 
                co-education in the college department.
            </p>

            <p><strong>In the Fullness of Time with Msgr. Gabriel</strong></p>
            <p>
                In 1997, Msgr. Manuel G. Gabriel’s leadership ushered organizational reforms, participatory management, updated 
                vision-mission, establishment of the Research & Development Center, and the creation of the Christian Formation 
                Office. PCC also achieved its first PAASCU Level I and Level II accreditations during this time.
            </p>

            <p><strong>From Parochial to Diocesan: The Stewardship of Bishop San Diego</strong></p>
            <p>
                In 2003, the Diocese of Pasig was formally recognized, with Bishop Francisco C. San Diego, D.D., as its founding 
                bishop and Chairman of the PCC Board of Trustees.
            </p>

            <p><strong>PAASCU and PACUCOA Accreditation</strong></p>
            <p>
                In 2018, the Grade School and High School received PAASCU Level III Re-Accredited Status. The College’s Education 
                and Business Administration programs achieved Level II Accreditation, while the School of Graduate Studies earned 
                its PACUCOA Level I Status.
            </p>

            <p><strong>PCC as a “Little Acre of Grace”: Msgr. Santos’ Legacy</strong></p>
            <p>
                Msgr. Gerardo O. Santos (2004–2015) infused dynamism, innovations, curriculum integration of values, partnerships, 
                staff benefits, and major infrastructure including the Centennial Building. He introduced the phrase “Little Acre 
                of Grace” and strengthened the school’s core values.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Pasig Catholic College with Bishop Vergara: A Centennial Institution</strong></p>
            <p>
                Under Bishop Mylo Hubert C. Vergara, PCC focused on formation, ecological involvement, pastoral priorities, 
                diocesan programs, and strategic educational leadership. His pastoral visits (2013 and 2020) reinforced PCC’s 
                mission and community spirituality.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Rev. Fr. Ordoña’s Leadership Priorities</strong></p>
            <p>
                Rev. Fr. Orlindo F. Ordoña strengthened Christian formation, K-12 transition, accreditation, Centennial Building 
                completion, and pandemic response programs, including the Learning Continuity Program and virtual accreditation.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Reconvening of PaDSS Commissions</strong></p>
            <p>
                PaDSS Commissions conducted strategic planning in 2021–2022, focusing on performance review, strategy development, 
                and execution.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Missio et Evangelizatio</strong></p>
            <p>
                At 109 years, PCC embraced the theme “Missio et Evangelizatio,” aligning with the Church’s 500 years of Christianity 
                celebration, emphasizing healing, mission, and evangelization.
            </p>

            <p><strong>PCC: Scaling Up Excellence in Catholic Education</strong></p>
            <p>
                PCC remains committed to forming young people in character and competence. Under Bp. Vergara as Acting President 
                and Fr. Daniel L. Estacio as Assistant to the President, the school continues to push excellence, curricular innovation, 
                strategic partnerships, and strong Catholic formation.
            </p>

            <p>
                PCC’s roots stem from the noble heritage of its CICM founders. More than a century later, its mission of evangelization, 
                service, academic excellence, and social transformation continues—reviewing the past, facing the present, and 
                conquering the future.
